# duet

## CAUTION

This is based on the work of zzeneg. The intent of this fork is to convert the duet into a standard x / min y spacing verison, to be used with [CMY keycaps](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/fingerpunch/tree/master/keycaps/CMY)  

In addition to this, I have added strong pinky stagger.  

Please reach out in the [fingerpunch discord server](https://fingerpunch.xyz/discord) if you are interested in building this.  

Everything below is the original readme, and has not been updated to reflect the changes in this repository.
